# XeroConnector
Simple library for integrate a .NET Core application to Xero.

The Xero documentation is not really clear and the examples are quite old. With the recent introduction of `OAuth` 2.0, it is a bit difficult and complicated to integrate your .NET application with Xero.

My goal is to have a package for a Xero Connector with basic functionalities. So, I can use it and share it. The functionalities I want to have are:</p>

- Get invoices
- Search an invoice
- Get an invoice as PDF
- Create a client/customer
- Create an invoice
- Refresh the access token
